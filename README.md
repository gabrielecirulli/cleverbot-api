# CleverBot API
[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/gabrielecirulli/cleverbot-api.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/gabrielecirulli/cleverbot-api)

A very basic and barebones API implementation for CleverBot.

If you're looking for an implementation in another language, you can check out Pierre-David Bélanger's version for *Mono/.NET*, *Java*, *Python* and *PHP* [here](https://github.com/pierredavidbelanger/chatter-bot-api).

## Installation
Installation is very simple. Just run:
```
gem install cleverbot-api
```
You can then include the CleverBot API in your programs with:
```ruby
require 'cleverbot-api'
```
That's it!

## Usage
This library is pretty easy to use. You can create a new bot using the method `CleverBot#new`, then make it think using `#think`:

```ruby
require 'cleverbot-api'

bot = CleverBot.new

puts bot.think 'Hello there.' #=> "How are you?"
puts bot.think 'Fine.'        #=> "Good."
```

### Backlog
You can also use the `#backlog` method to get access to an array of responses (first is the oldest, last is the newest).

Responses are instances of the `CleverBotResponse` class. You can access the question and its corresponding answer using `#question` and `#answer`.
```ruby
puts bot.backlog.first.question    #=> "Hello there."
puts bot.backlog.last.answer       #=> "Good."
```

### Credits
Many thanks to Pierre-David Bélanger for his support and his implementation of the API (over which I've partially based my own version).
